### References and Credits

#### Preface

**Special thanks to [pkillboredom](https://github.com/pkillboredom) and [Stefano Bono](https://github.com/SteeBono) for their open-source contributions to the original project [SteeBono/airplayreceiver](https://github.com/SteeBono/airplayreceiver).**

My implementation references the forked version from [pkillboredom/airplayreceiver](https://github.com/pkillboredom/airplayreceiver), and the code for audio decryption and decoding uses a modified version of the source code from that project.

> My original intention was to directly fork that project and make modifications and improvements based on it.  
> However, after carefully reviewing its source code and attempting some changes, I found that although the codebase was upgraded to .NET 8,  
> it still contained many outdated coding practices, obsolete NuGet package references, and poor type referencing and lifecycle management.  
> Additionally, the feature implementation remained incomplete and contained numerous coding errors.
> Ultimately, I decided to use it as a reference to gather relevant information and rewrite the project.

> There are very few reference documents available for AirPlay, and most of the existing literature is outdated.  
> In most documents, the AirTunes service version number remains at `AirTunes/220.68`.  
> Furthermore, descriptions of protocol details in some older documents are inconsistent, making it difficult to verify their accuracy; validation through code implementation became necessary.

### Features

+ [x] Supports multiple devices connecting simultaneously to the AirPlay receiver.
+ [x] Supports audio streaming from multiple devices in ALAC, AAC and AAC-ELD formats.
+ [x] Supports screen mirroring from multiple devices in H.264 format.
+ [x] Supports packet retransmission for real-time audio streams (fixes disconnection and packet loss issues present in the original implementation).
+ [x] Supports Dacp service for reverse control of audio connections.

### Features Under Development

+ [ ] Support for video stream streaming.
